1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates git repo, where all my commit history and meta data will be stored.
I need this in order to use Git version control.
2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It gives you an idea of a "cloud", where files are stored in-between the git repository itself and your
working directory. It gives you an opportunity to add files aka in your backpack and then pull them in your git repo
with a commit.
3.How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can get use of git diff to see what changes I've made and wheather this changes are
logically connected. In order to only make one commit per logical change.
4.What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches can be really helpful with different versions of the file, so you can be free experimenting with
your project and don't bother with that git checkout to the previous commit to catch the bug.
