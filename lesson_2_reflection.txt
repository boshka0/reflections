1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates git repo, where all my commit history and meta data will be stored.
I need this in order to use Git version control.
2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It gives you an idea of a "cloud", where files are stored in-between the git repository itself and your
working directory. It gives you an opportunity to add files aka in your backpack and then pull them in your git repo
with a commit.
