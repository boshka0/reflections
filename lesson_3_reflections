1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would definitely do so if I have to work in collaboration with other people, in that case they 
will have an ability to contribute to the project and to clone a remote repo on their computer
in order to work with it.
2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
That makes sence if I don't want this changes to interfere with my current working flow, maybe there will
arise some kind of issues and I don't want them to.
3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks is like a clone but directly on your GitHub page with a contribution to the creator. Clone just let you copy
the whole repo on your computer to work with it. Branches is just for commits it the same file, just creating an
alternative path. I would definitely use fork if I wanted to contribute to some kind of an open-source project.
I would use clone if I worked with my team on the same project. And branches are just for experiments and for creating
different versions.
