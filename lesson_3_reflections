1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would definitely do so if I have to work in collaboration with other people, in that case they 
will have an ability to contribute to the project and to clone a remote repo on their computer
in order to work with it.
2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
That makes sence if I don't want this changes to interfere with my current working flow, maybe there will
arise some kind of issues and I don't want them to.
